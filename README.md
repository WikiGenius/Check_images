# Principle Objectives of this program

## 1_ Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs

## 2_ Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs

## 3_ Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2

## 4_ Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run
